# NUS ME5405 Computer Project
## Project Execution 
Before executing the project, please **add all folders and subfolders to the MATLAB path**, and then execute the corresponding files.
- For Image1 (`chromo.txt`), the main function file is `Project1.m` in folder `Project1`.
- For Image2 (`hello_world.jpg`), the main function file is `Project2.m` in folder `Project2`.

## Image Classification
KNN, SOM, and SVM methods are implemented in image classification, and the source code is placed in the folder `Project2/classification`.
The dataset is in the folder `Project2/classification/p_dataset_26`.

### SVM
The main code of SVM Classifier for execution is :
```Matlab
classification_svm.m
```

### kNN
The main code of kNN Classifier for execution is :
```Matlab
classification_knn.m
```

### SOM
The main code of SOM Classifier for execution is :
```Matlab
classification_som.m
```
